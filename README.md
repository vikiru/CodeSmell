## Build and Run Instructions

### Setup

Ensure the relevant environment variables are set properly:

- `JAVA_HOME`
- `MAVEN_HOME`
- `joern`

`dot`, `joern`, `maven`, `java` and `python` must also be part of your system PATH variable to use this program.

### Build Instructions

Run the following command to clean and package the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Build the project files with Maven:

```bash
mvn install
```

### Run Instructions

In order to execute the main program via the terminal, run the following:

```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```

In order to run the program through the executable jar via the terminal, the following command can be used:

```bash
java -jar ./target/CodeSmell-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
```

## Testing Instructions

Run the following command to execute all of the tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

In order to skip invoking Joern (which can take a significant amount of time on older hardware), pass the command line argument to skip joern through maven like so:
```bash
mvn -Dskip=true javafx:run
```
